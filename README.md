This project works similar to MyFitnessPal. The user can add their daily meals to each category label: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks.

The main page has a tracker for the daily nutrition broken down into:
calories, fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, protein, sodium and sugar

The user can add a meal in 3 different methods:
1. scanning the barcode of any food or drinks.
2. entering a dish name and selecting a recipe that is similar to the dish they ate.
3. entering their own recipe and having the website calculate the nutrition value before adding it.
